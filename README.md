Title: Feature Request: Color Indicator for Doctor and Patient Joined Status on Kantoko Doctors UI
I would like to request a UI enhancement for the Kantoko Doctors interface. Currently, we have to manually check in Django to verify when both the doctor and the patient have joined an appointment. It would be more efficient if there were a visual indicator, such as a color change, that reflects when both parties have joined.

This new color should be different from the ones we already use, like purple.
